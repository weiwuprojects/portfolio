				<h3>User Interviews</h3>
				<p>
				The interviews consisted of asking users different types of questions about portfolio websites such as "What do you expect a portfolio site to look like? What kind of content would it have?". These helped to gain knowledge about what people expect of a portfolio website which helped to identify core features that should be included.

				<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
				<p>Competitor analysis is an evaluation of products that are similar to your product. This was done in order to find the strengths of other portfolio sites and also to detect weaknesses in my own site. 
				The competitors that I analyzed were portfolio sites of two web developers as they were direct competitors and most similar to the goal of my site. I also analyzed Squarespace, a website builder used by many for personal websites, as an inderect competitor.

				<h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
				<p>The feature value matrix is a analysis of potential features based on criteria such as value of feature to user and business and diffculty of implementation. The features that I chose to implement were a bio, projects, and skills. These were chosen because of how positively they scored on each criteria. </p>

				<h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
				<p>Feature prioritization is a method of comparing features in terms of their value to users and difficulty to implmennt. For this portfolio, I considered high business value as the most important criteria in prioritization.  This was because high business value features were the most important to the functionality and purpose of the site.</p>

				<h3>User Stories</h3>
				<p>The user stories gave me more insight into what I was to be accomplished with each feature. To craft each user story, I thought about what the user should feel when engaging with a feature. Doing this helped me identify  obstacles that were preventing users from feeling the desired experienced.</p>

				<h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
				<p>Performing the cognitive walkthroughs allowed me to witness how people were interacting with my site through a series of tasks and questions. This helped me detect usability issues, especially regarding site navigation and aesthetics. An issue that I had was that the content of the participant's responses did not reveal much, which may be a result of the quality of my questions.</p>

				<h3>User Tests</h3>
				<p> The user test that I chose were the 5-second test and the question test. I chose these tests and not the click test because I felt I could not gleam as much information from seeing where the user clicked. Though, question tests usually gave lengthier responses, sometimes users would not write a single word in order to finish quickly. For this reason, I feel that the cognitive walkthrough was the most valuable user testing method because I could get longer responses or clarification immediately. </p>

	<h1 class="center">Summary of Findings</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>In conducting preliminary research such as competitor analysis, I found that strong portfolios for web developers
	included standard elements such as projects and contact info, but they were implemented in a way that 
	was aesthetically pleasing and also gave the page some interactivity. Some of these portfolio sites were 
	rather short but effective because of typography, colors and animation.
	</p>
	<p>
	During user interviews, some participants expressed that a designer's website should look good and be reflective of the person's 
	design prowess. I concluded that the content didnt matter so much as the presentation and execution of
	the content. With this in mind, I implemented the core set of portfolio features but focused mostly
	on aesthetics and presentation.</p>

	<h1 class="center">Incorporation of Findings</h1>
	<hr>	
	<p>Thee two main issues found in the user testing was a boring and static site.
	To remedy the issue with the site feeling to static or boring, I added hover effects to the skills sections.
	Users also felt no incentive or need to explore the night button so I added a pulsing animation to gain the user's 
	attention and the make the site feel more alive.
	</p>
	<p>
	The user response to the plain white on black background was mixed. Some users thought the white was too plain while others 

	liked this stark and minimalist designThe solution to this was difficult to find and I questioned whether this was a valid site 

	problem. I struggled with the decision to keep or change the background color but in the end I decided on 
	the color #F7F8F9 as the new background color which makes the site easier on the eyes and also preserves the
	original site aesthetics.
